			<h3><u>Clay Soil</u></h3>
			<p>Clay soils contain more than 30 percent fine clay particles</p>
			<p><b>Clays swell and shrink as they wet and dry, effectively cultivating themselves</b></p>
			<p>Clay soils take longer to warm up in spring</p>
            <p><b>Wet clay soils are easily damaged when dug or walked on</b></p>
			<p>Drought is much less damaging on clay soils than others soil types</p>

			<h3><u>Oat seeds</u></h3>
			<p>Oats should be planted as early in the spring as you can get them out. To help reduce the weed levels in your field, you should try to do a cultivation in the fall,to bring up any seeds to the surface for the winter cold to kill. Dig again in the spring closer to when you're going to do your planting.
			You should plant your oats in a sunny location where it will be easy to access water for them. Oats need more water than most other grains, and you will probably have to water them if there are too many days between rainstorms.</p>

			<p>Though they like moisture, oats will not grow well in low-lying areas where water accumulates. The soil needs to be well draining.</p>

			<p>To sow your seeds, you just broadcast them out over the soil. Try to get the seeds evenly distributed. If you are going to be growing a larger area, you can get tools to help you spread the seeds. It saves your arm and will spread them more evenly.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, you will also have to go and cover all that seed once you're done. If you leave it all on the surface, you will surely lose most of it to the birds. Go over the entire area with a rake and turn over the soil to get the seeds at least an inch under the surface. One trick is to do your seeding right before an expected heavy rain. The water will beat the seeds into the wet soil, and do a pretty good job of covering without any more effort on your part.</p>

			<p>Though they may seem like a lot of work to process (see below) there is little work to be done during the growing season. Because oats are grown in a dense patch, you can't really get in to weed them and the plants generally need little care.</p>

			<p>You will need to give them a watering when the weather gets dry, which can be difficult if you are growing a large patch of them. But they don't do well in dry conditions, so either you water your oats or risk losing them.</p>
			<h3><u>Sprouts</u></h3>
			<p>Sprouting is easy, and does not require high tech equipment. Perhaps the biggest benefit of sprouting seeds is that it allows you to produce small-scale batches of fresh greens all year round. If winter gardening is too cold for your taste, or you grow in an area that does not support winter gardening, sprouting seeds are a great indoor growing option. Sprouting seeds are available in a wide variety of flavours and textures, and are thought to be especially rich in nutrients that are lost as plants mature. So while your vegetable garden is dormant over winter, you can still produce tasty, nutritious sprouts right on your kitchen counter.</p>

			<p>Sprouting is extremely economical. Only a teaspoon full of small seeds, or a tablespoon full of larger seeds is needed to produce a substantial sprout crop. The seeds themselves keep very well without losing their high germination rate, so a $5.00 bag of sprouting seeds can produce many pounds of sprouts as you need them. Store-bought sprouts would be significantly more expensive. By staggering sowing times, a constant supply of fresh sprouts can be maintained all year long.</p>
